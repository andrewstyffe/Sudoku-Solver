# Sudoku-Solver
This program solves a given sudoku puzzle.
I modeled the sudoku puzzle as a contraint-satisfaction problem (CSP) and used a backtracking search to find the correct values.
Right now it is configured so that the user must manually enter the initial state of the sudoku puzzle.
I would like to automate this in the future so that the program somehow reads in the initial puzzle and solves it all in one go.
